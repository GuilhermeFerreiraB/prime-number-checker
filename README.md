# prime-number-checker
An algorithm in which the user enters a number and the program checks if it's a prime number or not. After the number is input by the user, it's run a for loop to divide the number by every number from 1 up to the number itself and counted how many times the division's remainder is 0. If the counter is 2 the number is prime, otherwise it's not.
